# Price Predict
My Developer Challenge solution for Winter 2024

## A PyTorch-based machine learning tool to optimize a neural network for prediction of the approximate profit of a product given its details

Hello guys! I'm Aamish, a '26 who's looking to join the dev team at DALI, and this is a project in which I analyse the `Sample - Superstore.csv` dataset provided for the DALI Challenges and train a machine learning model (a neural network in our case) to predict the price of a product given its details.

Our analysis will include scouting out correlation between multiple factors and choosing a good mix of features to include for training our model. This will then be followed by a process of pruning down some of those features - some which might correlate with each other and some to balance computational efficiency with accuracy.

Subsequently, we will preprocess our data, clean it out a bit, remove bad data and just improve the overall uniformity of the data.

And after all that stuff, we'll train our model, performing some hyperparameter tuning using the `Optuna` framework. Through this search process, we will explore what a globally optimal model for this problem might look like, how hyperparameter changes affect the model and how do we go about training a better performing model. **Finding the ideal set of hyperparmeters is the final aim.**

With this project, my hope is to present some of my machine learning skills in practice, revealing my deep understanding of deep learning and general ML topics and maybe a thing or two along the way myself.

I hope you guys like this, and if you want to clarify something in this project, such as the usage of some code or API that might be a bit confusing, or if you are not able to replicate my results, feel free to reach out to my [email](mailto:aamish.a.beg.26@dartmouth.edu).
